## Building

To build the launcher yourself, follow the instructions on the Prism Launcher website, but clone this repo instead:

- [Windows](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions/windows/)
- [Linux](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions/linux/)
- [MacOS](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions/macos/)

## Notes

- You can easily use a custom version of authlib-injector on an instance. Select the instance in the main window, click "Edit" (or Ctrl+I/Command+I), go to the Version tab, click "Add Agents", and select your authlib-injector JAR. If your JAR is not correctly identified as authlib-injector, make sure the `Agent-Class` field in the JAR's MANIFEST.MF is `moe.yushi.authlibinjector.Premain`.
